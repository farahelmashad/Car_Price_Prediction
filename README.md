# Car_Price_Prediction

This project predicts used car prices using machine learning models and provides insightful data exploration through detailed analysis and visualization. It demonstrates the full data science pipelineâ€”from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment via an interactive GUI.

Key features include:  
- Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key price drivers  
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables  
- Building and evaluating regression models to predict car prices accurately  
- Interactive visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn for trend analysis  
- User-friendly GUI developed with PyQt to explore data and view predictions dynamically
  
This project showcases practical skills in data science, machine learning, and GUI development applied to a real-world regression problem.
